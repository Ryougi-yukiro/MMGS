Description: Package for Multi-envs Genomic Selection, contains Inbred Lines, CUBIC Lines and Light-cross Lines. For more details of the Norm Reaction Model, you can see the article: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2021.03.010>; and for the Polygenic Environment Interaction Model, please see the articles: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2022.02.012> and <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xplc.2022.100473>. Each of these two GS models explains the mechanisms of environmental interactions from a different perspective, so please read them in detail depending on the type of model you are using. The R package 'MMGS' was developed by Mingjia Zhu <z980907mj@gmail.com> and Yanjun Zan <>. This repository is forked from the original repository <https://github.com/Ryougi-yukiro/MMGS>.
